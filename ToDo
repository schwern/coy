* Add more vocabulary

* Add more grammar rules

* General clean and tighten :-)

Can do. Will do. Did do. Will be in the next release.

Err, that's tricky, since Coy needs to set things up as it loads. Hmmmm. I 
suppose you could pass a hash with the inline data to "use Coy":

	use Coy {
	          noun => {
                        wookie =>
                        {
                                category => [ Sentient ],
                                sound    => [ "roars", "grunts", "bellows" ],
                                act      =>
                                {
                                        sits   => { location => Arborial },

                                        fights => { minimum => 2,
                                                    association => "argument",
                                                  },
                                },
                        },

                 },
	};

I'll see what I can do.

Yes, this is needed and not too hard to add.

Always? How about randomly sometimes?

I certainly agree. Objects are *high* on the ToDo list.

Yes, this is also on the ToDo list.

Yes, this would be part of allowing new locations (see below).
